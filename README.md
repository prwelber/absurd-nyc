## Absurd NYC
New York is quite simply a ridiculous place. An assorted array of people of all types span across the 5 boroughs from homeless people dancing across the street, wall street bankers complaining about interest rates, hipsters on veagan kale diets, tourists walking down the street with their heads facing down or up, brogrammers discussing schema set ups while doing keg stands, and others. Absurd NYC takes you through on a journey through a day of these crazy people who populate this great city.
